## What is Process Lasso?

**Process Lasso** is an advanced system utility designed to optimize and manage running processes on Windows systems. It provides real-time adjustments to process priorities, CPU affinities, and power profiles to ensure smoother system performance, reduced lag, and improved responsiveness—especially under heavy loads.

With Process Lasso, users can:
- Automatically manage CPU cores and process priorities.
- Prevent system freezes and application hangs.
- Improve gaming and streaming performance.
- Extend hardware lifespan through smarter resource allocation.

It is widely used by gamers, developers, and IT professionals to maintain system stability and maximize efficiency without the need for manual tweaking.
